# üç± SQL Project 2: Food Delivery Time Analysis

This project analyzes real-world food delivery performance using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denniskuznets/food-delivery-time). I used **intermediate to advanced SQL queries** to extract insights related to delivery time, vehicle efficiency, courier experience, traffic conditions, and weather impact.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset `Food_Delivery_Times.csv` includes:

- `Order_ID`
- `Distance_km`
- `Weather`
- `Traffic_Level`
- `Time_of_Day`
- `Vehicle_Type`
- `Preparation_Time_min`
- `Courier_Experience_yrs`
- `Delivery_Time_min`

## üîç Objective

To clean and analyze food delivery data using SQL and uncover patterns across time of day, weather, traffic, vehicle types, and courier experience that affect delivery time and consistency.
